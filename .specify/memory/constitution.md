# AI/Spec-Driven Unified Project Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### I. AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation
Every book feature must be developed using Docusaurus and deployed to GitHub Pages. This ensures a consistent, version-controlled, and publicly accessible documentation platform.

### II. Integrated RAG Chatbot Development
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot will be built and embedded within the published book. This chatbot will leverage OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier. Its primary function is to accurately answer user questions about the book's content, including responses based on user-selected text.

### III. Reusable Intelligence (Subagents & Skills)
The project will explore and implement reusable intelligence through Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills. This aims to create a "Matrix-like" technology where subagents can dynamically load predefined intelligence (skills) into their context as needed.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.
