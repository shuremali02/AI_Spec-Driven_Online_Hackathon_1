command: Update my GitHub Actions workflow so that it deploys only the Docusaurus build output folder to GitHub Pages. The workflow must ignore all other project files and deploy exclusively the folder structure generated by npm run build (the build/ directory).

Ensure these requirements:

Deployment triggers automatically when I push to the main branch.

Only the build/ folder is uploaded.

No other folders or files from the repository are deployed.

The output should be a complete GitHub Actions YAML file placed inside .github/workflows/github-pages.yml.

Make sure the pipeline is optimized, clean, and strictly deploys only the Docusaurus build folder.

## Prompt

Update my GitHub Actions workflow so that it deploys only the Docusaurus build output folder to GitHub Pages. The workflow must ignore all other project files and deploy exclusively the folder structure generated by npm run build (the build/ directory).

Ensure these requirements:

Deployment triggers automatically when I push to the main branch.

Only the build/ folder is uploaded.

No other folders or files from the repository are deployed.

The output should be a complete GitHub Actions YAML file placed inside .github/workflows/github-pages.yml.

Make sure the pipeline is optimized, clean, and strictly deploys only the Docusaurus build folder.

## Response snapshot

I have updated the GitHub Actions workflow file `.github/workflows/github-pages.yml` to specifically deploy the `build/` directory generated by Docusaurus to GitHub Pages. This workflow will now:

- Trigger automatically on pushes to the `main` branch.
- Install Node.js dependencies.
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to create the Docusaurus output.
- Upload only the `build/` directory as a Pages artifact.
- Deploy the uploaded artifact to GitHub Pages.

This ensures that only your Docusaurus build output is deployed, ignoring all other project files.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: GitHub Actions workflow for Docusaurus deployment updated successfully.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: .github/workflows/github-pages.yml modified
- 🔁 Next prompts: N/A
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully updated the GitHub Actions workflow to specifically deploy Docusaurus build output to GitHub Pages, adhering to all user requirements.
