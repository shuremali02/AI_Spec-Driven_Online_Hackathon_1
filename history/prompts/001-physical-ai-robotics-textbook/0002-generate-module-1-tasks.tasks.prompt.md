## Prompt

```
/sp.tasks
```

## Response snapshot

Generated a detailed task list for Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals, covering setup, foundational configurations, and chapter-specific content creation, code examples, and diagrams. Tasks are structured for independent execution and review.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Task list for Module 1 generated successfully, aligning with the plan and specification.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (Tasks are for content creation, not code that requires automated tests at this stage).
- 📁 Files: `tasks.md` created with 59 tasks.
- 🔁 Next prompts: `/sp.implement` or direct execution of tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are granular, actionable, and cover all aspects of Module 1 content creation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
